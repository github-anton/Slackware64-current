Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

If your video card does not support hardware-accelerated OpenGL, then run the
script like this:  OPENGL=NO ./wine.SlackBuild

You can compile Wine in a few ways:

Wine32+Wine64 -> multilib   x86_64
Wine64                      x86_64
Wine32                      x86

Wine32+Wine64+staging       staging x86_64
Wine64+staging              staging x86_64
Wine32+staging              staging x86

BUILD_W64="yes" - compile Wine64
BUILD_W64="no"  - do not compile Wine64

BUILD_W32="yes" - compile Wine32
BUILD_W32="no"  - do not compile Wine32

BUILD_STAGING="yes" - compile with staging
BUILD_STAGING="no"  - compile without staging

To compile with staging download respective wine-staging.zip form the GitHub, then rename it as wine-staging-<wine ver>.zip.
